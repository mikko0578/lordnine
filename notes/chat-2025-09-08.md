# Chat Log - 2025-09-08

Purpose: Capture today's Codex session context and code changes.

## Summary
- Added Revive flow and prioritized it in the main loop.
- Improved Grind flow robustness: post-teleport random delay + wait for HUD bag icon.
- Introduced multi-spot grinding with per-spot templates and paths; GUI management + selector.
- Extended GUI asset uploads to include revive and bag icon assets.
- Updated build specs and script to package the app into executables reliably.

Additional updates (2025-09-10)
- Recorder now captures configurable keys and mouse clicks (Windows fallback if `mouse` module missing). GUI messages updated; fixed Manage Spots record-path crash.

## Changes Made
- l9/flows/revive.py
  - New `ReviveFlow` with states to click Revive, optional Stat Reclaim, and Retrieve.
  - Uses pyautogui locate with configurable ROI `rois.revive_ui` and thresholds/timeouts under `revive`.

- l9/flows/grind_refill_loop.py
  - In `LState.CHECK`, runs `ReviveFlow` first. After revive, checks potions: refill if empty, else go to grind.

- l9/config_loader.py / l9/config.yaml
  - Added `revive` section (templates and timeouts) and `rois.revive_ui`.
  - Added random post-teleport timing: `timings.teleport_post_wait_min_s`, `teleport_post_wait_max_s`.
  - Added `grind.bag_icon_template`, `bag_icon_timeout_s`, `bag_icon_roi`.
  - Added spot system: `grind.active_spot_id`, `grind.spots` (3 default entries).

- l9/flows/grind.py
  - Spot-aware templates via `_spot_templ()`; path file defaults to `spot{active_id}.json`.
  - Added WAIT_HUD state to wait for bag icon after teleport.
  - Added randomized 2â€“3s post-teleport delay.

- scripts/gui.py
  - Upload Assets: added Revive templates and Bag Icon.
  - New Manage Spots dialog: rename spots, upload per-spot templates, record path per spot.
  - Added Spot dropdown to select `grind.active_spot_id`.

- scripts/record_grind_path.py
  - Records to `spot{active_id}.json` when `grind.area_id` is not set.
  - Now captures key down/up for configurable `grind.record_keys` (default WASD; extended to include E, Z) and mouse clicks. Uses `mouse` if present or WinAPI fallback.

- Build
  - lordnine_gui.spec / lordnine_runner.spec: added hidden imports; bundle `l9/assets/**` and `l9/config.yaml`.
  - scripts/build_exe.ps1: dependency check + builds GUI and Runner; copies runner next to GUI.

## Notes / Decisions
- Mouse clicks are performed at exact coordinates; movement glides smoothly before the click.
- Mouse click recording does not require new deps on Windows; optional `mouse` module provides richer hooks.

## Quick References
- Revive flow: `l9/flows/revive.py`
- Loop integration: `l9/flows/grind_refill_loop.py`
- Grind updates: `l9/flows/grind.py`
- GUI updates: `scripts/gui.py`
- Config: `l9/config_loader.py`, `l9/config.yaml`
  - `grind.record_keys` controls which keys are recorded; default now includes W, A, S, D, E, Z.
- Build: `lordnine_gui.spec`, `lordnine_runner.spec`, `scripts/build_exe.ps1`

## Condensed Transcript
1) Added Revive flow; integrated with priority before potion checks.
2) Extended GUI Upload Assets for revive images; added Manage Spots and selector.
3) Implemented multi-spot grinding (per-spot templates and paths); updated recorder and GrindFlow.
4) Added post-teleport randomized wait; added bag icon wait gate before path replay; GUI upload for bag icon.
5) Updated PyInstaller specs and build script for packaging both GUI and Runner.
6) Clarified that clicks target exact coordinates and discussed mouse/keyboard recording feasibility.
