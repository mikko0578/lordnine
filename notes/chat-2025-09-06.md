# Chat Log — 2025-09-06

Purpose: Save today’s Codex session context and changes for easy continuation tomorrow.

## Summary
- Project: Lordnine Windows automation (vision + input) with flows orchestrated by `GrindRefillLoop`.
- Focus today: reliability/usability tweaks — cursor glide, click behavior, dismantle dismissal, quieter logs, and human-like randomization.

## Changes Made
- l9/flows/dismantle.py
  - Added `_click_at_cursor()` and replaced center-window click in `DState.DISMANTLE` with a click at current cursor position (dismisses dismantle result reliably).

- l9/actions/input.py
  - Added `_smooth_move_to()` and `_get_cursor_pos()` to glide mouse to targets before clicking.
  - Click flow now performs a smooth move before mouseDown/Up, respecting:
    - `input.mouse_move_duration_ms`
    - or randomized per-click duration with `input.mouse_move_duration_ms_min`/`max`.
  - Added `_action_pause()` to inject human-like random pauses after each action when enabled.
  - Applied `_action_pause()` to `move`, `click`, `press`, `press_once`, `hotkey`, `type_text`.

- l9/flows/grind_refill_loop.py
  - Removed noisy “still has potion” log; now logs only when empty (“no more potion”).

- l9/config_loader.py
  - Added defaults:
    - `input.mouse_move_duration_ms: 0`
    - `input.mouse_move_duration_ms_min` / `input.mouse_move_duration_ms_max` (optional)
    - `timings.random_action_pause: false`
    - `timings.action_pause_min_ms: 1000`, `timings.action_pause_max_ms: 3000`

- l9/config.yaml
  - Enabled smooth glides and randomization with example values:
    - `input.mouse_move_duration_ms: 250`
    - `input.mouse_move_duration_ms_min: 180`
    - `input.mouse_move_duration_ms_max: 320`
  - Enabled per-action random pause:
    - `timings.random_action_pause: true`
    - `action_pause_min_ms: 1000`, `action_pause_max_ms: 3000`

## Tuning Notes
- Glide speed: adjust `input.mouse_move_duration_ms_min`/`max` (ms). Remove them to use fixed `mouse_move_duration_ms`.
- Disable glide: set durations to `0`.
- Human-like pauses: toggle `timings.random_action_pause`, tune min/max (ms).
- Dismantle dismissal: now clicks wherever the cursor is — you can hover a safe area to receive the result.

## Condensed Transcript
1) Auto-approve prompts: confirmed this session runs with `approval_policy=never`.
2) VS Code chat history: explained where sessions are stored and how to persist/export.
3) Ingested `L9_AI_CONTEXT.md`; summarized architecture and flows.
4) Confirmed understanding of app design and constraints.
5) Dismantle flow: replaced center-window click with cursor-position click.
6) Mouse felt like teleporting: added smooth glides before clicks.
7) Reduced log noise: removed “still has potion”.
8) Further smoothing: added step-wise fallback for glide.
9) Random glide speeds: added min/max duration per click.
10) Random per-action pauses: added 1–3s configurable delays.

## Next Ideas (optional)
- Apply the same glide randomization to `Actions.move(...)` calls if you want non-click moves to glide by default.
- Add a small “calibration” script to preview cursor glides and pause timing live.
- Consider enabling debug screenshot dumps selectively for tricky detections.

## Full Transcript

User: is possible to do auto approve prompts?

Assistant:
Yes. In fact, this session is already auto‑approved.

- Current mode: approval_policy is `never`, so I can run shell commands and apply patches without prompting you each time.
- Other modes: `untrusted`, `on-failure`, `on-request`, `never`. Auto‑approve corresponds to `never` in your Codex/runner config (how you set it depends on your launcher).
- Safety: Even with auto‑approve, I’ll still ask before installing new packages, adding networked steps, or doing destructive actions, per your repo guidelines.

If you meant auto‑approving in‑game confirmation dialogs instead, I can add a small flow to detect and click those prompts—share the specific prompt(s) and template screenshots, and I’ll wire it up.

User: also where is the history of my chats? when I close vs code its also gone

Assistant:
Short answer: In this setup, your chat isn’t auto‑persisted to the repo, so closing VS Code clears the in‑memory conversation unless your chat extension saves it.

Where VS Code keeps chats
- Built‑in Chat (workspace): `%APPDATA%\Code\User\workspaceStorage\<workspaceId>\chatSessions`
- Built‑in Chat (no folder open): `%APPDATA%\Code\User\globalStorage\emptyWindowChatSessions`
- Extension‑specific chats: under `%APPDATA%\Code\User\globalStorage\<publisher>.<extension>`.

Why yours disappears
- Many chat extensions don’t persist the active session by default. If the extension doesn’t save per‑workspace sessions, closing the window loses the thread.

How to keep it
- Check your chat extension’s settings for history/session persistence/export.
- Use the “Chat Sessions” view (built‑in Chat) to pin a session.
- Manual export: copy all or export to `notes/chat-YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

User: okay nevermind just check the L9 AI CONTEXT to see what is going on in this application im building

Assistant:
I’ll open `L9_AI_CONTEXT.md` and summarize the key architecture and goals.

Assistant:
Yes — I’ve read L9_AI_CONTEXT.md and the code, and I have a clear picture.

- Lordnine Windows automation: on-screen vision + synthetic input to run in‑game flows.
- Orchestrator: `GrindRefillLoop` checks potions, refills if empty, then resumes grinding.
- Flows: `return_town`, `dismantle`, `buy_potions`, `grind`.
- Vision: OpenCV TM_CCOEFF_NORMED, multi‑scale, ROI, NMS; capture via `mss`.
- Input: `pyautogui`/`pydirectinput`/WinAPI; window focus guard; panic key.
- Assets/config under `l9/assets/**` and `l9/config.yaml`.

User: I want you to know the context of what i am currently building and you will find it in L9_AI_CONTEXT.md tell my if you have a clear understanding of the application

Assistant:
Yes — I’ve read L9_AI_CONTEXT.md and the code, and I have a clear picture.

- What It Is: Lordnine automation; orchestrated grind/refill loop.
- Architecture: flows, vision, capture, input, safety.
- Core Loop: check potions → refill sequence → grind.
- Assets & Config: under `l9/assets/**`, `l9/config.yaml`.
- Run: GUI `scripts/gui.py` or CLI `scripts/run_flow.py`.

User: ok in this code block ... the self._click_center_foreground() doesnt seem to work I want you to change it to a simple click on the place where the mouse is currently

Assistant:
Change made: replaced the center-window click with a click at the current mouse position after dismantling.

- Updated: `l9/flows/dismantle.py`
- Added: `_click_at_cursor()` helper and used it in `DState.DISMANTLE`.

User: can you make the mouse move not like its teleporting?

Assistant:
Done. The cursor now glides to targets before clicking instead of teleporting.

- `l9/actions/input.py`: smooth pre‑click move using `mouse_move_duration_ms`.
- `l9/config_loader.py`: default for `mouse_move_duration_ms`.
- `l9/config.yaml`: set duration to ~120ms.

User: can you also remove the log "still has potion" and make it just 1 log then no more

Assistant:
Updated to reduce log spam: removed the “still has potion” log and only log when empty.

- `l9/flows/grind_refill_loop.py`: logs only “no more potion” when empty.

User: hmmm it seems like the cursor is still like teleporting between different click instances. I want it to be like a normal when you drag your mouse to that location then clicks it

Assistant:
I’ve made cursor movement smooth before each click so it glides from the current position to the target. Added fallback stepwise WinAPI motion.

- `l9/actions/input.py`: `_smooth_move_to` with pyautogui tween or WinAPI steps.

User: is it possible to put random speeds of each mouse glide?

Assistant:
Yes — I added per‑click random glide durations.

- `l9/actions/input.py`: random duration between `mouse_move_duration_ms_min/max`.
- `l9/config_loader.py`: added min/max keys.
- `l9/config.yaml`: set example min/max (180–320ms).

User: can you also put random timeouts per action? 1-3 secs including milliseconds

Assistant:
Added random per‑action pauses, 1–3 seconds by default.

- `l9/actions/input.py`: `_action_pause()` after move/click/press/etc.
- `l9/config_loader.py`: defaults for `random_action_pause` and min/max.
- `l9/config.yaml`: enabled with 1000–3000ms.

User: can you put this conversation on a file so that we can go back to this tomorrow

Assistant:
Saved a concise session log you can revisit tomorrow: `notes/chat-2025-09-06.md`.

User: yes please do

Assistant:
Exported the full transcript (this section) into the same file.
