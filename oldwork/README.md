Old Work Dropzone
=================

Place your previous scripts, macros, and notes here for reference.

Suggested contents
- Scripts: Python or other automation files you used.
- Flow notes: brief description of the goal, steps, timing, and edge cases.
- Assets: any templates/screenshots referenced by the scripts.

I will review these and translate the logic into a structured state machine under `l9/flows/`, identify missing assets/ROIs, and align config in `l9/config.yaml`.
